### Introduction: "From Carpentry to the Cloud: A Self-Taught Tech Transformation"

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. I'm David Cannan, currently an evangelical developer at MinIO, and today, I want to share with you a story. It's not just any story--it's my story, a tale of transformation, resilience, and the power of AI in self-education.

A year ago, I stood in a very different place. My world was about precision and craftsmanship, not in bytes and algorithms, but in wood and lacquer. I was deeply involved in woodworking, a profession that honed my patience, attention to detail, and the ability to envision a finished product from a raw piece of material.

However, life has a way of presenting unexpected pathways. Faced with personal challenges, including overcoming addiction and dedicating myself as a single father to triplet boys, I found myself at a crossroads, searching for a new direction.

That's when technology caught my eye. But how does one transition from woodwork to the intricate world of software engineering and cloud technologies? Traditional routes like bootcamps or formal education weren't my path. Instead, I turned to a tool that has revolutionized learning: ChatGPT-4 by OpenAI.

Armed with nothing but determination and access to this advanced AI, I embarked on a self-taught journey into the realms of hacking, programming, DevOps, and eventually, cloud storage technologies. Every day was a step in a new direction--learning Python, understanding containerization, exploring infrastructure as code, and delving into cybersecurity.

ChatGPT-4 wasn't just a source of information; it became my tutor, mentor, and collaborator. It helped me break down complex concepts, guided me through coding challenges, and even assisted in building AI solutions and custom bots.

This journey wasn't easy. Balancing learning with being a single father to triplets, managing an internship at MinIO, and building my personal brand required discipline and tenacity. But it also brought out the best in me, teaching me that with the right tools and a relentless spirit, anything is possible.

Today, I stand before you not just as a testament to self-made success but as an example of how AI tools like ChatGPT-4 can democratize learning and empower individuals to reshape their careers and lives.

In this talk, I'll dive deeper into how I leveraged open-source resources and AI to not only learn but to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the world of cloud storage at MinIO.

So, let's embark on this journey together, and I'll show you how from a world of wood shavings and lacquer, I entered the world of bytes and cloud architectures, all thanks to the power of AI-assisted learning.
