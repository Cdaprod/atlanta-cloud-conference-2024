Giving a talk on home grown development

Nowadays, it’s not unbelievable for someone who has little to know knowledge of technology, to create their own "aws" infrastructure with artificial intelligence built-in. With the explosion of access to amazing open source knowledge and repositories; even someone who has no inclination on how these things work can easily attain the knowledge in a manner that is suitable to their learning style just by implying it. 

It’s not been long and we’re already at the point where local development and open source is entirely capable of sustaining production level functionality. 

Today I’ll be outlining the way in which I went about learning, in order to be able to create my own software by learning from the open source resources that so many have came together to create. 

Minio S3, Weaviate vector database, Langchain framework, Python language, LLM engine, api inference gateway for ETL and whatever my mind can imagine!
